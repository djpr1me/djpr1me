Hello, my name is [Roman Biriukov](https://github.com/djpr1me). I have 15+ years in startups, launching 25+ products (B2B, B2C, SaaS, on-prem, native) in BI, HealthTech, TrafficTech, Reporting, and E-commerce. I handle discovery and delivery—acting as both product and project manager—coordinating multiple teams, stakeholders, and departments. With extensive MVP and experimentation experience, I align product strategies with market trends and user needs, set OKRs, identify pain points, and gather requirements. Leveraging agile, I excel at backlog and roadmap management, quickly adapt to change, and balance speed vs. quality under tight constraints. I’m independent, transparent, and focused on results. I also create demos, tutorials, and docs. Recently, I’ve integrated GPT into products and am exploring local LLMs, building RAG pipelines for pet project.

Outside of work, I love 🎧 [DJing](http://djpr1me.com) and building/riding 🏍️ pitbikes. I’ve even created a [knowledge base](https://github.com/djpr1me/mypitbike) with manuals, schemes, and service instructions. I'm also a longtime 🏎 sim racer (since 2002), designing and building [sim rig cockpits](https://github.com/djpr1me/Sim-Rig-Cockpit) in CAD, and tinkering with [DIY hardware](https://github.com/djpr1me/Button-Box) using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I’m fascinated by the history of the video game industry, retro-gaming, and hacking/modding consoles. Last but not least, ❤️🐈!
