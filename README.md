Hello, my name is [Roman Biriukov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djpr1me/djpr1me/main/biriukov_cv.pdf). I have 15 years in digital & product development, launching 25+ solutions (B2B, B2C, SaaS, on-prem, native) in BI, HealthTech, TrafficTech, Reporting, and E-commerce. Focused now on Gen AI and NLP technologies. Guided the journey from 0 to 1, taking products from concept to launch.
I handle discovery and delivery—acting as both product and project manager—coordinating multiple teams, stakeholders, and departments. With deep MVP and experimentation experience, I shape product strategies driven by market trends and user needs. Skilled in setting OKRs, identifying pain points, gathering requirements, and excelling at agile backlog and roadmap management.

Outside of work, I love 🎧 [DJing](http://djpr1me.com) and building/riding 🏍️ pitbikes. I’ve even created a [knowledge base](https://github.com/djpr1me/mypitbike) with manuals, schemes, and service instructions. I'm also a longtime 🏎 sim racer (since 2002), designing and building [sim rig cockpits](https://github.com/djpr1me/Sim-Rig-Cockpit) in CAD, and tinkering with [DIY hardware](https://github.com/djpr1me/Button-Box) using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I’m fascinated by the history of the video game industry, retro-gaming, and hacking/modding consoles. Last but not least, ❤️🐈!
