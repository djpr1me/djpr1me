Hello, my name is [Roman Biriukov](https://github.com/djpr1me). I'm a seasoned Product/Project Manager, Scrum Master, QA Engineer, and UX/UI Designer with over 10 years of experience. Being a head of product is like being a Swiss Army knife ‚Äì you need to have a deep understanding of every process involved. To excel in this role, it's crucial to possess a solid grasp of programming, database analysis, UX engineering, design, software testing, and end-user experience. I am passionate about creating products that users love, and I bring this drive to every project I work on.

Over the past five years, I have focused on building healthcare startups using NLP, AI technologies, a rule-based decision support system, and FHIR API.
Prior to this, I was involved in the creation of PowerLinage, an iOS and cloud app designed for genetic counselors and genetic labs. The tool was later acquired by Invitae Corporation and rebranded as the [Family History Tool](https://familyhistory.invitae.com/). Additionally, I contributed to the development of the [Aluna Health](https://web.archive.org/web/20171011010657/https://www.alunahealth.com/) habit builder/health tracker mobile app.

Throughout my career, I have launched a traffic management tool and participated in over 20 projects. I am an independent, responsible, and flexible fast-paced professional. I strive to learn something new every day and am constantly adapting my own plans and those of my team based on new inputs and feedback, with a focus on continuous improvement of the development process.
